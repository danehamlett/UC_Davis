    "- The optimal solution to maximizing revenue for the Washington Post is ~\\$523,200.\n",
    "- Based off of this sensitivity analysis, I would advise the newspaper to optimize their contracts around risk tolerance, and altering CPC (Cost Per Click) rates:<p></p><br>\n",
    "If the given revenue maximization results of the original model yield an optimal potential revenue amount of ~\\$523,200, the newspaper would ideally want to minimize the risk of ever failing to hit that target. Companies like Capital One typically have a smaller variance when simulating a sensitivity analysis for an expected CTR range. The expected revenue projections don't deviate as much as some of the other companies, and the average revenue observed when running the sensitivity analysis actually exceeds that of the original model. In order to persist a healthy level of customer satisfaction, the newspaper may want to hold their CPC rate steady, or even offer a slight discount, to increase the probability from a more predictable revenue stream.<p></p>\n",
    "Conversely, companies like Gieco and T-Mobile exhibit a larger variance when simulating a sensitivy analysis, resulting in higher volatility in the segment. At the lowest point in the sensitivity modeling, the expected revenue dips well below the optimal revenue amount for the original model, and on average they are at par with the original model. Given the increased risk involved with these companies, the newspaper may want to increase their CPC, to mitigate this risk, and account for any discounts given to companies with a less risky profile.<p></p>\n",
    "Ultimately, the Washington Post should assess their risk tolerance, and ensure their ideal goal is to maximize revenue. By altering their CPC strategy, and avoiding overpaying companies that may not yield an optimal ROI, they minimize their risk, and lock in a more predictable revenue stream.\n",

    "The results of the joint optimization yield a higher profitability, than that of running each Plant independently (\\$400 max profit, vs \\$385). Assuming the CEO of of these plants is interesting in yielding the highest level of profitability across all of his plants, I would make the recommendation to spread the raw materials for the standard and deluxe products across both Plants. Given that Plant B may have older machines than those in Plant A, we can confirm that the proper allocation of materials are leveraged at Plant A, while increasing the amount of materials (and ultimately output) of the deluxe product at Plant B. As opposed to making an arbitray split of resources, the company will have greater control of where it's resources go, ultimately reducing costs, and maximizing profitability. This would potentially lead to more predictable profitability forecasts, and an overall improvement in operations."

    "1. According to the regression equation given above, which variable positively affect Profitability? Which variable negatively affect Profitability? Does this intuitively make sense? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The variables that will positively affect profitability include:\n",
    "    - Price of the Inn\n",
    "    - College students in the area\n",
    "\n",
    "    This intuitively makes sense, as the price of a hotel room will inherently increase profitability. A simple revenue formula can be calculated as # of Hotel Rooms Booked * Price per Room. Profit is calculated by Revenue - Costs, so this is pretty straight-forward. Middle-sized hotels may also be more popular in 'College Towns', where a student's family may be visiting the student, and looking for a more economical source of lodging. The larger the number of college students, the more likely that their families will be looking to stay at a hotel.<p></p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using this regression equation, LQM created a spreadsheet model to predict profitability. LQM collected data for several locations in California, which is provided in the excel spreadsheet on Canvas “LQM”. Using this spreadsheet, compute the profitability for each hotel. Which one has the highest profitability? Which one has the lowest profitability?<p></p>\n",

    "<p></p>\n",
    "    - Highest Profitability = Hotel 2 (Fresno, California)\n",
    "    - Lowest Profitability = Hotel 8 (Los Angeles, California)\n",
    "<p></p><br><br>\n",
    "3. LQM has a budget of \\$10M to spend on hotels. Suppose we used a “greedy” approach where we selected the most profitable hotels until we ran out of budget. So we would start by the most profitable, and then if we had enough budget left, we would buy the hotel we predict to be the second most profitable, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Based off of the \"greedy\" approach we would only be able to purchase hotel number 2 (Fresno, California). This is due to the fact that this hotel is the (a) the most profitable, and (b) has a price tag of \\$10M. After purchasing this hotel there would be no more money left to purchase any additional hotels.\n",
    "    - Our total predicted profitability would be ~\\$53.4M.\n",
    "    - If we are trying to maximize our total predicted profitability, this isn't necessarily a good approach. Given that we are only purchasing one hotel under this scenario your profits would be limited to only one location, and the value is overstated as this hotel has the lowest profit to price ratio (~.00053). However, if we had a budget of \\$20M, our hotel selection would be vastly different, ultimately increasing the potential profits from \\$53.4M to ~\\$404M.\n",
    "<p></p><br>\n",
    "4. Now, build an optimization model to select hotels given the $10 million budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - _(see model description below)_\n",
    "    - Given a \\$10M budget, the optimal solution would be to purchase hotels 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 for a total cost of \\$9.8M. The expected profitability would be ~$269.92M.\n",
    "    - This does make sense intuitively, when compared to the 'Greedy Scenario, given there are a greater number of hotels selected, with a higher aggregate estimated profitability. With this scenario we see an estimated profitability of ~\\$269.92M, vs ~\\$53.4M, and we have saved \\$200k in cost.\n",
    "<p></p><br>\n",
    "5. LQM thinks that buying too many hotels in one city is probably not a good idea and would prefer to diversify across as many cities as possible. Add constraint(s) to your model to limit the number of hotels purchased in any city to at most 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The constraints that will need to be added to the model, will need to limit the number of defined hotel purchases in the model to <= 2, per a respective city. Based off of this additional constraint, I would expect the new optimal function to be smaller, given the limitation of available hotels per city. We may potentially be passing over more profitable hotels within a larger city, to avoid purchasing more than 2.\n",
    "    - As expected, this model did not prove to be as profitable, yielding an expected profitability of ~\\$204.21M vs ~\\$269.92. However, this model did allow us to come \\$1.175M under budget.\n",
    "<p></p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In one paragraph (no more than 300 words), describe how you would present your results to LQM. Do you have any recommendations for them to improve the regression model? How about to improve the optimization model?\n",
    "\n",
    "    I would present the results in the form of a recommendation table to LQM. Specifically, I would focus on not only the profitability, but the overall value and ROI of each investment model. Based off of assessing the Profit to Cost ratio, we could deduce the most 'Valuable' model, where the highest ratio would yield the highest profitability for the least cost. I would also factor in risk, as a qualitative derivative of this metric, noting that it would be more risky to invest in a non-diversified model with minimal profits.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Though the model which limited hotel investments to 2 locations per city is not the most profitable, nor does it reflect the highest Profit to Cost ratio, it does allow for LQM to save a considerable amount in costs, allowing them to test each market without risking a loss on their investment. By showcasing a multi-threaded recommendation plan, it allows LQM to make the best decision for their business, and assess their decision from multiple angles.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In order to improve the accuracy of their regression model, which ultimately drives their estimation of profitability, I would have LQM focus on conducting additional market research, and increasing the sample size of hotels in the model. Given there are less than 30 hotels in the model, you can't necessarily rely on the application of the Central Limit Theorem, and you would increase the probability of your model's accuracy with a greater sample size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As far as improving the optimization model, I would look to factor in fixed and variable costs as potential constraints. Though we are already optimizing around profitability, it would be key to understand what costs are impacting profitability and whether or not they can be controlled, prior to a hotel purchase. These improvements would ultimately yeild a more holistic view.<p></p><br>\n",
